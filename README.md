Built a secret passcode for the LEDs to light up ðŸ‘€

I made this for the Aurora Pathfinder workshop. Different combinations lead to different LEDs lighting up. It's meant for fidgeting or if you just want gamify it and try to create an LED pattern.

I struggled learning how to do the footprints for KiCAD the most, since navigating the file directories was hard for me. I also had to learn how to do routing in a certain way (using two different layers and whatnot). I had fun thinking of what to code my PCB to do, and I'm excited to see it!
